# WDI-Post-Graduation-Keep-Coding

# Keep Growing as a Coder Post Course

The most important thing is to find ways to keep yourself motivated. 

You'll have strong days where you'll want to really challenge yourself and push yourself out of your comfort zone. 

And you'll also have days where you are focusing on an upcoming interview, tired, or your confidence is shaky or you just feel down. These are the days that are also really important to find ways to keep growing as a developer. 

Developing good habits right after graduation will help you keep your momentum and help lift you up when you're feeling down

## Set Weekly Code Goals

Post-graduation can be a tough transition from a super structured environment to where you are on your own to figure out what you should learn next. If you don't know what to learn next or are completely stuck on ideas, use this markdown to set weekly code goals. Stay consistent or mix it up. Here are a lot of low stakes and easy ways to keep going.

## Engage With the GA Community

You'll be invited to an alumni channel after graduation. Use it! Your classmates relate to your struggles more than anyone else right after graduation. 

On the NYC campus, alumni are welcome to use the work space during the day (9am - 5pm). Many alumni would go to campus at least three times a week and use the workspace as a way to focus on coding. Many times graduates would sit together, talk about what they are working on, go to lunch together or grab drinks at the end of the day. 

Make this happen remotely! You all know how to use Zoom. Make rooms for set times throughout the day and have 'study hall'. Get together and spend that time working on projects, talking and sharing. 

Work on your own stuff but have other people there around you, also working on their stuff. Camaraderie is great!

Share your portfolios and practice giving and getting constructive feedback. 

Make a clan on [codewars](https://www.codewars.com/) and get your cohort to join, see if you can find another cohort to challenge! Join Karolin [here](www.codewars.com/r/bEqEeQ)

Team up and teach each other something! Get a group of people and have everyone spend 10 minutes explaining something cool they learned or going through a code challenge.

Sign up for an online hackathon

Team up on a project!

You can also use the slack channel to share interview experiences and code challenges. It is totally ok to talk about what kinds of code challenges you are getting! (It is not recommended that you copy paste the full details of the challenge unless the company says it is ok) 

OK Examples:

1. I had to whiteboard how I would build a randomly generated maze
1. I had to walk my interviewers through code for a binary search tree written in Java and explain what the output would be
1. I was given seven days to build a weather app that you could put in a zip code and it would show the hourly and seven day forcast
1. I was told to build one server that takes in data from two clients that randomly generate numbers and put that data into a flat file, in Ruby, in four hours
1. I had to build a picture carosel with vanilla js and css
1. I was given a very complex css mockup with a four hour deadline and I had to submit it on bitbucket!
1. I had 24 hours to build a multi-level drop down menu on top of 3000 lines of html that looked like it was generated by Adobe Dreamweaver
1. I had to solve clock hands, closed book, on paper, and given a grade
1. I had to write 20 SQL queries on paper, also closed book
1. I had to white board the data models for a complex dungeon crawler game with multiple users in front of 10 people

This is a great way to learn about what kinds of challenges are out there an a great way to get inspired to learn something new 

## Maintain a Web Presence 

There are some really low-key, low-stakes ways to keep your web presence!
- Keep making commits to github! Try to make commits a few times a week, even if you are working through a tutorial, make a new repo and push that code up: For safekeeping and to show people that you're still coding post-course
- Use codepen/js fiddle to try new tech out, build little demos, follow a tutorial, share something with others
- Do code challenges on hackerrank and/or codewars

A super thing to do is to get involved with an open source project: it can be really scary and intimidating, so it's ok to take your time to find the right thing for you 

## Level Up with JavaScript Fundamentals

Now is the time to dive deeper and really enhance your knowledge. There are many ways to do it, choose the one that suits your learning style and mood

If you are feeling really rusty, go to CodeAcademy and do their codealongs (and CSS/HTML too)


**READ:**
- At least one article from [JavaScript Weekly](https://javascriptweekly.com/) a week
- [Eloquent JavaScript](https://eloquentjavascript.net/) and work your way through the code examples
- Another JavaScript book that works with your learning style (and share it with your GA community!)
- Algorithm Tutorial on [CoderByte](https://coderbyte.com/)
- Get into intermediate/advanced JS topics with the book series [You don't know JS](https://github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS)
- [33 Concepts ever JS programmer should know](https://github.com/leonardomso/33-js-concepts#readme)

**DO:**
- At least 1 code challenge from [hackerrank](https://www.hackerrank.com/) or [code wars](https://www.codewars.com) or [coderbyte](https://coderbyte.com/) a week Join Karolin [here](www.codewars.com/r/bEqEeQ)
- Set a once a week 'retro day' where you go back to a morning exercise, lab or lesson and do it from scratch

- Push yourself. Kata on code wars are rated 8 is super easy, going up to 1 which is quite hard. Challenge yourself to do 5 a week, like the NYT, start with an 8, then a 7, then a 6, then a 5, then a 4. Even if you don't finish 6 - 4, even trying is helping and you'll get reinforcement with the simpler ones!

- A lot of people enjoy [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/)
- And [Leet Code](https://leetcode.com/) is also a popular way to level up

**Watch**

Yes! Many parts of these videos can go over your head! That's ok, you'll still learn a lot and you can always watch them again. Once you get these videos going, youtube will recommend even more great videos!

  - [Watch someone reverse engineer a pop under](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPzRcZLNCPY)
  - [What the Heck is an Event Loop Anyway](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGhZQkoFbQ)
  - [Learning Functional Programing with JavaScript](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-5obm1G_FY)
  
  Also, good stuff can be on [Twitch(There are great videos on Twitch ie here is one using React)](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/237646100))

## Level Up Your CSS

**READ:**
- Read at least one article a week from [Front End Focus](https://frontendfoc.us/)
- Read [Learning Web Design a Beginner's Guide to HMTL, CSS, JavaScript and Web Graphics](http://wtf.tw/ref/robbins.pdf)
- Read CSS Tricks

**DO:**
- Some free tutorials (too many to list! Google it!) 
- Go to a design site like [dribbble](https://dribbble.com/) and try to build your own html/css version
- Try to build your favorite site with css and html
- Draw some wireframes and try to build them
- Team up with a classmate
- Team up with a designer

## Build Something

It can be really hard to go back to an old project from your time in WDI. Instead, start from scratch and build something that is new and exciting to you! 

When starting again, think about best practices, focus on 
 - Better code: better indentation and whitespace, better comments, better commit messages, committing more often etc. - Show you can write clean organized code that looks professional
 - Try something like: [Linter-JS-Standard](https://atom.io/packages/linter-js-standard) - preconfigured easy install on atom. Choose Standard, Semi-Standard or Happiness for the right format. Resolve each and every error and/or write custom rules. This also catches unused variables, which can help clean up your code as well
 - Better work flow - use trello, github projects, github issues - demonstrate you are organized, consistent and can communicate effectively about code
 - Write a good README.md
 


Unit 1 - the game! Some great (simpler) games to try to build
 - Tic Tac Toe
 - Connect Four
 - Black Jack
 - Hangman
 - Card game - War
 
 Unit 2 - Server-Side Rendered CRUD App with Node, Express and Mongo
 
 Unit 3 - Front End Framework MEAN Stack
 
 Unit 4 - Rails and React
 
 Project Ideas: 
 
- Build a passion project that is trying to solve something (this is the best thing you can be working on, but sometimes you have coder's block and don't feel inspired at the moment, that's ok! Build something simpler)
- Go with a classic, like a todo list so you can focus on the technical portion
- Go with your own simple idea, just trying to complete CRUD, so you can practice project management and building a cohesive app, keep a list of cool features and build those once you have the basics down

## Level Up Computer Science Fundamentals

**READ:**
- Cracking the Code
- Learn about Big O Notation. [Great intro here](https://rob-bell.net/2009/06/a-beginners-guide-to-big-o-notation/)

## Be Fair to Yourself and Avoid Common Pitfalls
- Figure out how many hours you can spend this week on coding and follow through
- Set realistic goals: 60 hours of coding on your own is not realistic for most people. So try 3 or 6 or 12. Maybe say 30 minutes a day for at least 4 days
- Don't beat yourself up when things go sideways, take a moment to acknowledge what you've learned and move forward
- Instead, when you've accomplished something share your achievement! Go to the alumni channel and share it or treat yourself in a small way when you succeed. Be kind to yourself.
- Don't try to learn 5 languages at the same time. If you're not sure if you want a job in JS or Ruby, or Python or PHP or Java DO NOT try to learn all the languages at the same time. Rather pick one or two, build stuff and practice. If you change your mind, that's fine, but don't try to learn too many new things at once.
- The same goes for front end frameworks, back ends and more. Focus on less and doing it better. Focus on finishing one project and then think about changing. Don't try to do 5 projects at once.
- Don't buy too many books on the same topic. The first chapters are usually easy. Then they all get harder. Find the one or two books on a topic that work for you and reread chapters and work through the tough parts, the same goes for tutorials- there is always a part where they get hard. Stick with it - espically if you know it is a good tutorial.
- On the flip side, many tutorials can be total garbage. Do a little research before committing to a tutorial
- If you are not succeeding - lower the bar. Don't laugh, it's serious! Perhaps you are setting goals that are too lofty. That will block you from making progress and cause you to be unnecessarily frustrated with yourself, scale it back, doing a tiny little something is far better than doing nothing. 
- Try not to hide from your friends. Reach out. Send a text, a DM, keep those connections strong, they'll help you weather the tough times.
